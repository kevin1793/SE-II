Wanderer: Have you heard that the Dragon King Magmadroth has awakened again?
Hero: Yeah I'm on my way to slay him.
Wanderer: That's suicide, the last man to defeat him lost his life in the process.
Wanderer: On top of that no one has been able to pull the Dragon Slayer Sword from it's stone.
Hero: Oh, I already did that. 
Wanderer: I wish you well then, you're our only hope.
