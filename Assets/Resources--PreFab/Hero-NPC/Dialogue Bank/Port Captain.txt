Captain: Like my ship?
Hero: Yeah it's awesome, can you take me to Far East Island with it?
Captain: Nope, I don't give free rides.
Hero: I'll pay you.
Captain: Ha you wouldn't have enough money.
Captain: I'm sure that old man over there would let you use his canoe.
Hero: You're a jerk.
Captain: Yeah a jerk with a giant ship.
