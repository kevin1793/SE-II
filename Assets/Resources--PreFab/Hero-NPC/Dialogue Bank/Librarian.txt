Librarian: Hi welcome to the Town Library.
Hero: What do you know about the Dargon King Magmadroth?
Librarian: Magmadroth is an invincible ancient Dragon King who unleashes his plague of dragons upon the world.
Hero: So he's unkillable?
Librarian: Not exactly, he is an entity who will always reincarnate.
Librarian: He also can only be hurt by the legendary Dragon Slayer Sword.
Hero: Where is the sword?
Librarian: It is southwest of the town, however only the hero of legend can pull the sword from the stone.
Hero: Ha I got this, my first name is Hero.
Librarian: ...
Hero: So...where do I find him?
Librarian: He dwells in an island east of here.
Hero: Looks like I'll have to find a boat.
